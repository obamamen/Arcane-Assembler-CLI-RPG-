## Overview

The Wizard Fantasy Game is an evolving project that aims to provide an engaging CLI-based gaming experience. Developed entirely in C without external libraries (for now), this game sets the groundwork for more complex features in the future.

- **Behind the Scenes**:
  - A fairly complex world map.
  - Basic entity management.
   
  
## Short term project goals

 - Simple spell system
 - Inventory managment
 - New enemy types
