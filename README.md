# ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the Wizard Fantasy Game! ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the **Wizard Fantasy Game**! This is a command-line interface (CLI) based game where you can explore a fantasy world as a wizard. The game is written in C and currently focuses on some basic functionality.

## Overview

The Wizard Fantasy Game is an evolving project that aims to provide an engaging CLI-based gaming experience. Developed entirely in C without external libraries (for now), this game sets the groundwork for more complex features in the future. 

This game is a turn-based RPG with a focus on magic combat. There will be numerous monsters to defeat, spells to unlock, and items to gather.
